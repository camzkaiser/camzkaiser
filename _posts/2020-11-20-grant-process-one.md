#Grant Process: Part One

Applying for a grant can be intimidating. There are so many steps and requirements that can scare off beginners like myself. However, this mock-grant application project has helped me learn more about the process. I know I still have a lot to learn, but this experience has made the grant application process feel less daunting!

My proposed project is a podcast about the works of Shakespeare and the digital humanities projects that they have inspired. Each episode would focus on one digital humanities project about Shakespeare's work. The host of the podcast would interview the creator of the project and the work that inspired it. This allows for meaningful conversations about Shakespeare’s works and digital humanities projects. The target audience of this podcast would be high school students, but it could also appeal to undergraduate students.

As a student, I had no idea what digital humanities was before I signed up for this class. Now that we are almost to the end of the semester, I know how much this field has to offer. These projects can be great resources for students because they often present the information in a new and engaging way that can appeal to different types of learners. Unfortunately, most students don't even know these projects exist.
Shakespeare is a common topic in the digital humanities world, as I have learned. It is also commonly taught in all four years of high school across America. This podcast will take advantage of Shakespeare's place in the literary canon to expose more students to digital humanities.

My goal is to capture students' attention with Shakespeare. These students are already familiar with Shakespeare, and this could serve as a resource for their studies. From there, I will help students engage with the texts and the digital humanities projects they inspired. Through this podcast, students will learn about digital humanities while listening to conversations about Shakespeare!

I didn't think this project would require much research on my part. I assumed that because I have experience with Shakespeare and education, I would coast through this part of the assignment. Though these things have helped me find my footing, I was quickly humbled by the environmental scan. I didn't realize that this project would require research on the effectiveness of podcasts in education too.

After a couple of emails back and forth with Dr. Stover, I learned a lot about my project itself. Though the podcast focuses on Shakespeare and other digital humanities projects, I have to focus on how to make this podcast successful in its educational mission. This presented an unexpected learning curve for me in the early stages of the project. I still have a lot of work to do, but after talking to Dr. Stover about this, I feel much better about where I am in my project!

In my research stage, I also found Folger’s podcast _Shakespeare Unlimited_. As a Shakespeare student, I had to listen to an episode of this podcast, and I realized that their podcast is similar to my project idea. Folger invites Shakespeare scholars to be guests on each episode. The host and the guest then talk about various issues in relation to Shakespeare's works.

The episode I had to listen to featured Keith Hamilton Cobb. The host interviewed him about his new play, _American Moor_. This play is about an African-American man auditioning for a production of Shakespeare's _Othello_. In the interview with Cobb, the podcast is able to explore the topic of race in relation to _Othello_ and within the American context. The conversation between the host and Cobb is both meaningful and eye-opening. I thought it was very interesting and engaging as a student!

This episode of Folger's _Shakespeare Unlimited_ focuses on a project and starts a valuable conversation based on it. However, the world of digital humanities is not explored or shared. This is where my podcast differs from Folger's podcast.

In my podcast, I would like to have those meaningful conversations too. However, the vehicle for these conversations would be Shakespeare-inspired digital humanities projects instead. This fulfills my wish to engage students with the texts and the world of digital humanities in one podcast.

The more I think about this project, the more excited I get! Though I still have a long way to go, I feel confident that I can finish this mock-grant application. Who knows, maybe this dream podcast will become a reality and a resource for other students like me!
