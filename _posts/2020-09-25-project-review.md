##My Review:

The Most Timeless Songs of All-Time is a visual essay, written in 2014 by editor of The Pudding Matt Daniels. Daniels introduces his project by stating that “this is a story about proving, with data, that No Diggity by Blackstreet is timeless” (Daniels). Starting the essay with such a playful tone introduces his analysis of the data on the popularity of songs and entertains his readers. Daniels uses data from Billboard charts to represent a song’s popularity at the time of release. Daniels then uses data from Spotify to represent a song’s popularity now. Using these two sets of data, Daniels compares the popularity of songs over time. One of the major trends he noticed is that songs from decades past that are very popular now weren’t top-charting songs in their own time.

  The main technological feature throughout this project was the use of interactive charts. These charts bring the data to life in a way that is easy to understand and navigate. However, these charts are not very accessible because there is no alt text for them. Without the alt text, the essay loses some of its impact due to the importance of the visual and interactive element of the charts. However, because of the amount of interaction and the data contained within each chart, this would prove to be a large task.

It is very interesting to see how the data of the Billboard charts of the past compare to the music streaming data of today. However, the streaming data is now outdated. It has been six years, and this visual essay has not been updated. It would be very interesting to see how the data has changed in the last few years. In 2014, top-charting artists, such as Taylor Swift and The Beatles, still did not have their music on Spotify. Now that the majority of top-charting artists are on Spotify, Daniels’s data could completely change. Updating this essay with current data could also engage newer and younger audiences even more. As it is now, it seems to focus on engaging with the millennial generation.
	Overall, as a music fan, this project was engaging and interesting. It was simplistic and entertaining but still informative. It was very fun to navigate the charts and watch as the data came to life. However, if Daniels updated his visual essay by adding alt text and current data, it could engage a wider audience.
