# Hello, friends!

My name is Camille (pronouns: she/her), and I am a senior English major and Psychology minor here at Christopher Newport University. As a senior, this year is all about change for me. When I came to college, I was convinced that being a high school English teacher was the right path for me. The idea of spending my days with the sassy and sarcastic teens of future generations, literature, and literary analysis (on the most basic level, of course) sounded like a dream. It wasn't until the end of last year that I decided to start exploring other career options. 

This decision had nothing to do with teaching and everything to do with my new mission to push myself out of my comfort zone--out of the box. So here I am, in a course titled Writing for the Digital Humanities (English 350). I had never heard of Digital Humanities, but I knew that if I was going to push myself out of my own little corner of the world, I would have to start with broadening my knowledge and skill set, and what better way to do that than to start within my own department! I have spent countless hours in literature and writing courses, and I thought it was time to see what Digital Humanities was all about.

Given that I am also a college senior during a global pandemic, my personal life has also faced some big changes! I have always been really passionate about personal growth and mental wellness, so I spent a lot of time (and I mean **a lot**) getting to know myself again and finding what brings me joy. Some of these things are my on-campus extracurriculars.

Outside of academia, I am a sister, and the recruitment analyst, of the Theta Nu Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi sorority, a founding brother of the Eta Pi chapter of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity, a Front Desk Assistant in York River Hall, and a big fan of outdoor activities and creative projects (especially anything involving paint, photography, and writing)! 

Back home, I am an older sister to a soon-to-be 17 year-old little brother and a dog mom to a two-year old goldendoodle named Juno (a.k.a. June Bug, or just Bug).
